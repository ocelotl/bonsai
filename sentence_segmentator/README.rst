Bonsai Sentence Segmentator
===========================

The *sentence segmentator* is an AI model that separates a document into
sentences.

Apparently (asking ChatGPT) )there are at least 2 models that we can use to
perform this task:

1. BERT
2. GPT

`spacy` seems to have a function that does this too. It may be based on one of
the models above. I'll implement an example.
