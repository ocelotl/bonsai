Bonsai Data Generator
=====================

This component uses ChatGPT to create normative and non-normative sentences.

The normative sentences are generated in pairs, a *formal normative sentence*
and an *informal normative sentence*.

The non-normative sentences generated by ChatGPT do not require further clean
up, but the normative sentences do. ChatGPT usually generates the pairs in
irregular ways, sometimes producing the output separated in halves, one for
formal and another one for informal normative sentences, sometimes it
intercalates them. Sometimes, ChatGPT also includes irrelevant sentences in the
output which need to be removed.

This component also includes a *fixer* which fixes the ChatGPT-produced output.

It does this by finding a sentence in the output, then looking for the sentence
that most closely matches it in the rest of the output. This is a `O(N^2)`
process where `N` is the number of sentences. I tried first with another
approach that did not use the sentence comparison method mentioned above, but
it was extremely hard to handle all the oddities of the ChatGPT-produced
output.
